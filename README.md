# Configuru Extension

This is the README for the `configuruhelper` extension.

## Features

This extension is a helper for the `configuru` library. It provides: 
- suggestions of name variables for the `config.ts` file from `env.jsonc` file
- if the `config.ts` file contains a variable that is not present in the `env.jsonc` file, the extension will underline it as an error.

**Enjoy!**
